This project aims to determine the association between alcohol consumption and helmet use in pedalcyclists ðŸš²

We are using the National Trauma Data Bank's Trauma Quality Programs Participant Use File (NTDB TQP) from the American College of Surgeons.

We envision this research providing a basis for preventing alcohol-associated biking injuries and improving safety practices.
